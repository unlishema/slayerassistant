    <h2>05/20/2021 - Redesign Started</h2>
    <p class="nistext">Due to a major computer crash that required a re-install of the OS, all source for the database updater was lost. This lead to a complete redesign of the app for many reasons, but the biggest was due to the system not supporting cluster tasks.</p>

    <h2>05/12/2021 - Project Started</h2>
    <p class="nistext">Here is a little history on how this app came to be.</p>
    <p class="nistext">After a long conversation with <a class="link" onclick="openDiscordUser('Zykrow#8009');">Zykrow</a> on the viability of a new slayer app for Alt1, I started doing some research on creating Alt1 apps and come to find out it is not hard but not easy either; however, redesigning the wheel is bad practice so lets see if anyone else has already created an app like this.</p>
    <p class="nistext">To my suprise there was one; however, it was outdated and no source code was known to exist for it. Oh well. Time to start designing it then.</p>
    <p class="nistext">The original Slayer Decision App was used as a base for the look and feel for the new app I started creating. The original app can be found <a class="link" onclick="window.open('https://runeapps.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=570');">here</a>.</p>
    <p class="nistext">There was a lot discussed on what could be added to the app; however, quite a bit of it was for way later on once the app was made and working. So here is a list of what was planned for the first release.</p>
    <ul class="nistext">
        <li>Ability to search for an assignment</li>
        <li>Compare 2 Assignments side by side</li>
        <li>Basic Information for Assignments</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Kills Required and Total Exp</li>
            <li>Creature information</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Name, Image, Location, and Examine Info</li>
                <li>Level, Slayer Lvl, LP, Defence</li>
                <li>Max Hits for Melee, Range, Magic, and Spec</li>
                <li>Weakness (aka. Melee, Range, Magic)</li>
                <li>Exp for Combat, Lifepoints, and Slayer</li>
