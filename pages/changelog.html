    <h2>06/22/2024 - Bug Fixes and Future Updates</h2>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>Bug Fixes:</b> Quite a bit of minor (and a couple major) bugs that poped up during the newest development of
        the app has been fixed in this release. There was quick pushes for the major bugs to get rid of them as fast as
        possible.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>Basic Settings Added:</b> Basic settings have been added, more will come in the future. The current settings
        will allow at least simple control over the app so far. A few to more coming soon is search and lookup history.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>Updates to Allow Better Future Updates:</b> Quite a bit of the backend of the app has been re-wrote to allow
        better future updates. A couple examples are adding settings to allow better usability of the app, making other
        looks for the app to allow a more personal feel for the app, and adding comments to the code along with
        restructuring it to be easier to navigate and understand. All of these changes were to allow the next future
        updates to be easier to implement and the settings are working but not all of them have been added where you can
        change them. This should come in the next update.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>A few Tweaks:</b> There is also a few tweaks to different parts of the app that happened as well due to these
        changes. The About Page width has changed to make it easier to read. The LookNFeel of the app has been slightly
        altered during the update due to making it more flexible for the future style update. The LookNFeel also has a
        limited UI option now that is changable in the settings.
    </p>

    <h2>06/15/2024 - Added Counter UI Support</h2>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>Slayer and Reaper Counter UI:</b> Full support added. When collapsed, it updates only the current assignment
        count; when expanded, it loads and updates the assignment unless it's already loaded.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>Task Comparison:</b> Compare Slayer tasks by separating them with a "|". Note: Reaper assignments cannot be
        compared.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>Suggested Slayer Assignments:</b> For level 120, "Select Your Own Assignment" dialog now includes suggested
        tasks. Search "suggest" in the search bar to view suggestions.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>Navigation Enhancements:</b> Navigate forward and backward through lookups, making it easy to revisit
        previous tasks and suggested assignments.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>UI Adjustments:</b> Improved look and feel for all pages when resized. Additional tweaks are planned for
        perfection.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>Project Adjustments:</b> Updates now designed to avoid disruptions, ensuring smoother future Alt1 updates.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>Code Refactoring:</b> Improved readability and data separation into Readers for better portability. Skillbert
        can now extract Readers for the main Alt1 source.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">
        <b>New DevTools:</b> Added debugging functions for testing and resolving issues.
    </p>

            Kitty</a>, I was finally able to add the first bit of
        user experience features to the app making the list of creatures smaller and easiler to navigate. Also default

    <p class="nistext">Soon after doing the redesign of the Database Updater, a major bug came up that almost crashed

        the way I created the app at all.</p>

    <h2>06/11/2021 - Redesign Revealed</h2>
    <p class="nistext">Revealed the redesigned look and feel of the Slayer Assistant to the Development channel on
        RuneApps Discord. Public didn't have access to the app but got to see it's progress.</p>

    <h2>05/20/2021 - Redesign Started</h2>
    <p class="nistext">Due to a major computer crash that required a re-install of the OS, all source for the database
        updater was lost. This lead to a complete redesign of the app for many reasons, but the biggest was due to the
        system not supporting cluster tasks.</p>
    <p class="nistext">After a lot of discussion with <a onclick="openDiscordUser('Zykrow#8009');">Zykrow</a> on the
        matter, I started working on the new database
        updater and redesigning the Alt1 app.</p>

    <p class="nistext">With a lot of assistance from <a onclick="openDiscordUser('Skillbert#9582');">Skillbert</a> on

    <h2>05/12/2021 - Project Started</h2>
    <p class="nistext">Here is a little history on how this app came to be.</p>
    <p class="nistext">After a long conversation with <a onclick="openDiscordUser('Zykrow#8009');">Zykrow</a> on the
        viability of a new slayer app for Alt1, I
        started doing some research on creating Alt1 apps and come to find out it is not hard but not easy either;
        however, redesigning the wheel is bad practice so lets see if anyone else has already created an app like this.
    </p>
    <p class="nistext">To my suprise there was one; however, it was outdated and no source code was known to exist for
        it. Oh well. Time to start designing it then.</p>
    <p class="nistext">The original Slayer Decision App was used as a base for the look and feel for the new app I
        started creating. The original app can be found <a
            onclick="window.open('https://runeapps.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=570');">here</a>.</p>
    <p class="nistext">There was a lot discussed on what could be added to the app; however, quite a bit of it was for
        way later on once the app was made and working. So here is a list of what was planned for the first release.</p>
    <ul class="nistext">
        <li>Ability to search for an assignment</li>
        <li>Compare 2 Assignments side by side</li>
        <li>Basic Information for Assignments</li>

                <li>Max Hits for Melee, Range, Magic, and Spec</li>
                <li>Weakness (aka. Melee, Range, Magic)</li>
